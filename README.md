## MicroSD Breakout

This is a simple, but useful board for connecting directly to a MicroSD socket.  I've taken great care to get the measurements for the board as close to spec as possible, but depending on the manufacturing process for the board, your mileage may vary with regards to the exact fit. I usually find that a small amount of filing gets it just perfect.  When you have it manufactured, be sure to choose .7-.8mm thickness.

At the moment, I'm using these to connect to an SD switcher circuit vi 8-pin IDC cables.
